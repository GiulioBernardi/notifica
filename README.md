I made this script to automate a manual process to check if a table was updated by another team.

Everyday, me and my team open the company directories. We need to open folder after folder to find the excel file, and then we need to check the last modified date before.

I googled some way to solve this problem and I found [this tutorial](https://tonyteaches.tech/detect-file-change-python/) teaching how to check for update in pdf's

So I used it as inspiration to think in my own logic.
